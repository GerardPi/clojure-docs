== Introduction

This is information and links about the Clojure programming language.
This reason for this document is mainly for myself so I don't have to remember all of these details.

== Why is Clojure a nice idea

. State and identity are not conflated
  ** Usually everything you do in Clojure is immutable
  ** That is usually not a problem thanks to structural sharing
  ** When mutability really is required (no place oriented programming)
  ** When you must have mutable stuff, it can be managed really well:
     *** Atoms
     *** Agents
     *** Refs and Software Transactional Memory
     *** Locks
     *** Future, Promise
     *** CSP (core.async)
. Code is data and data is code (homoiconicity)

=== For building web-applications
 
. https://github.com/weavejester/compojure
. https://github.com/juxt/yada
  ** https://juxt.pro/yada/manual/index.html
  ** Yada used to use Component, but switched to Mount
. https://luminusweb.com/
  ** Uses Mount
. https://github.com/duct-framework/duct
  ** Uses Integrant

== Editors with Clojure support

. Intellij IDEA with Cursive plugin
  ** I use IDEA on a daily basis, with a Vim plugin.
. Emacs
  ** Since Emacs itself is programmed in a Lisp, Clojure it seems only natrural to use it as a development environment for Clojure.
  ** Since I'm used to VIM, but Emacs is a bit more luxurious than VIM, I occasinally use Emacs. But I use the Spacemacs flavoured Emacs with the Cider plugin in Evil mode: https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/clojure/README.html
  ** Cider: https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider
. Vim
  ** Can be used to start Clojure repl from VIM.
. http://lighttable.com/
  ** In ClojureScript, but no longer maintained?
