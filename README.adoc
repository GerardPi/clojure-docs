== Introduction

This is information and links about the Clojure programming language.
This reason for this document is mainly for myself so I don't have to remember all of these details.

== Why is Clojure such a nice idea

. State and identity are not conflated
  ** Usually everything you do in Clojure is immutable
    *** That is usually not a problem thanks to structural sharing
    *** When mutability really is required (no place oriented programming)
    *** It means that usually a location in memory holding a location will not be changed after it is allocated. https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-state-of-immutability-169d2cd11310[Place Oriented Programming] is a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize[premature optimization].
  ** When you must have mutable stuff, that state  can be managed really well:
     *** Atoms
     *** Agents
     *** Refs and Software Transactional Memory
     *** Locks
     *** Future, Promise
     *** CSP (core.async)
. Dynamically typed (compile time) and strongly typed (run time) language makes for more readable code.
  ** However, you can add type hints for performance reasons (static typing).
. Code is data and data is code (homoiconicity)
  ** https://www.booleanknot.com/blog/2016/12/20/code-is-data.html
. Very clean code without much ceremony
  ** You can do the same in C++ or Java. But is it less readable.

Downside of Clojure: it's pretty strange coming from any mainstream imperative programming language.
