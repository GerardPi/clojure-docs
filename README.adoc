== Introduction

This is information and links about the Clojure programming language.
This reason for this document is mainly for myself so I don't have to remember all of these details.

== Why is Clojure such a nice idea

. State and identity are not conflated
  ** Usually everything you do in Clojure is immutable
  ** That is usually not a problem thanks to structural sharing
  ** When mutability really is required (no place oriented programming)
  ** When you must have mutable stuff, it can be managed really well:
     *** Atoms
     *** Agents
     *** Refs and Software Transactional Memory
     *** Locks
     *** Future, Promise
     *** CSP (core.async)
. Dynamically typed (compile time) and strongly typed (run time) language makes for more readable code.
  ** However, you can add type hints for performance reasons (static typing).
. Code is data and data is code (homoiconicity)
  ** https://www.booleanknot.com/blog/2016/12/20/code-is-data.html
. Very clean code without much ceremony
  ** You can do the same in C++ or Java. But is it less readable.

Downside of Clojure: it's pretty strange coming from any mainstream imperative programming language.

=== For building web-applications
 
. https://github.com/weavejester/compojure
. https://github.com/juxt/yada
  ** https://juxt.pro/yada/manual/index.html
  ** Yada used to use Component, but switched to Mount
. https://luminusweb.com/
  ** Uses Mount
. https://github.com/duct-framework/duct
  ** Uses Integrant

=== Dealing with relational database


. https://github.com/jkk/honeysql
. https://github.com/metabase/toucan
  ** On top of HoneySQL
. https://github.com/korma/Korma
  ** Clojure DSL for dealing with your database
. https://www.hugsql.org/
  ** Embraces SQL and generates Clojure code from SQL files.
. 

== Editors with Clojure support

. Intellij IDEA with Cursive plugin
  ** I use IDEA on a daily basis, with a Vim plugin.
. Emacs
  ** Since Emacs itself is programmed in a Lisp, Clojure it seems only natrural to use it as a development environment for Clojure.
  ** Being a VIM user, and Emacs being a bit more luxurious than VIM, I occasinally use Emacs. But I use the Spacemacs flavoured Emacs with the Cider plugin in Evil mode: https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+lang/clojure/README.html
  ** Spacemacs Clojure Quick Ref: https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/spacemacs-basics/emacs-quick-reference.html
  ** Spacemacs Basics: https://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs/spacemacs-basics/
  ** Cider: https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider
. Vim
  ** Can be used to start Clojure repl from VIM.
. http://lighttable.com/
  ** In ClojureScript, but no longer maintained?

== Nice stuff

PS: Obviously, this list is incomplete: if you stuff about Clojure is not in this list, that does not mean that it is stuff is not nice :-)
